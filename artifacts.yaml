# Can use any environment variables here (format: ${VAR}):
#   - EXT = the ArkCase extension ID (i.e. 'core', 'foia', 'dc-owc', 'usitc', etc.)
#   - VER = the overarching ArkCase version being packaged
#   - PORTAL_UI_VER = the portal UI version to use (defaults to ${VER})
#   - PORTAL_API_VER = the portal API version to use (defaults to ${VER})
#   - other variables are also supported

# This matches the structure within the artifacts containers
# "/app/file" exactly, such that you can expressly indicate
# where you want each artifact to go.
#
# Example:
#   artifacts.arkcase.wars."filename-1.war" -> /app/file/arkcase/wars/filename-1.war
#
# Maven artifact specs follow this pattern:
#
#   "artifact-name.ext":
#     enabled: (true|false , optional, self-explanatory)
#     maven:
#       repository: maven-repository-id (as defined in the authentication section)
#       group: maven-group-id
#       artifact: maven-artifact-id
#       version: maven-version-number
#       type: maven-artifact-type
#       classifier: maven-artifact-classifier
#
# Direct download artifact specs follow this pattern:
#
#   "artifact-name.ext":
#     enabled: (true|false , optional, self-explanatory)
#     direct:
#       credentials: "credentials-id" (as defined in the authentication section)
#       url: the-url-to-download (can be file:///... or any other valid URL)
#       version: artifact-version
